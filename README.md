Code For DC Website
=============

This is the repository for the website for Code for DC, the DC chapter of the Code for America Brigade program.

This site is built on Github pages and uses Jekyll for its blog.

To make changes:
1. We strongly recommend that you set up a local copy of the site and test your changes there before pushing them back to the repository!  
2. Work against the Master branch.  Master == Staging.
3. The production website is hosted off of the 'gh-pages' branch.  You shouldn't work against this, but when you have publication-ready changes in Master, you can pull those across to gh-pages to make them live.  The reason for maintaining separate master and gh-pages branches is that it enables people to work against a shared master branch and merge back to it without needing to make the code ready for production first.
