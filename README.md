DC Legal Hackers website
=============

This is the repository for the website for DC Legal Hackers, the underlying [source code](www.github.com/codefordc/codefordc-2.0) is from our friends at Code for DC. 

This site is built on Github pages and uses Jekyll for its blog.

To make changes:
+ We strongly recommend that you set up a local copy of the site and test your changes there before pushing them back to the repository!
+ Work against the Master branch.  Master == Staging.
+ The production website is hosted off of the 'gh-pages' branch.  You shouldn't work against this, but when you have publication-ready changes in Master, you can pull those across to gh-pages to make them live.  The reason for maintaining separate master and gh-pages branches is that it enables people to work against a shared master branch and merge back to it without needing to make the code ready for production first.
