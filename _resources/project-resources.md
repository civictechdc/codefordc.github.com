## HTML/CSS

[Pa11y](https://github.com/nature/pa11y): Test your site for accessibility

## Licensing your work and collaborating

Licensing sounds boring, but it's the best way to keep your code open to others. If you don't provide a license, your work is presumed to be fully copyrighted and therefore closed to others. Code for DC recommends keeping your license in a `LICENSE.md` file. If any explanation is necessary for contributions by others, we recommend including that in your readme or in a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Web frameworks

Frameworks allow you to create templates and scripts for a dynamic site

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/): The web framework used by Github Pages; probably most useful if you are using that for hosting

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): A full-featured framework built on Python

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/): Another Python framework; fewer features and less powerful, but simpler to set up

[Express](http://expressjs.com/guide.html): A Node-based framework

[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/): A Ruby-based framework

## Javascript Libraries

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/): Add interactivity to your site

[Typeahead](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/): Autocomplete functions for forms

[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/): Additional Javascript functionality to make programming simpler

## Hosting

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): Apps with low data needs are free, and the price after that scales with usage

[Dotcloud](https://www.dotcloud.com/): Another hosting option

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/): Your code already lives there and hosting is free, but all of your information will be out in the open (if passwords, etc. are required, this can be a security risk).

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/): Relatively cheap cloud hosting for anything, including static files

## Font Families and Icons
