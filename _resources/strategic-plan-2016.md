## Executive Summary

Code for DC is a group of committed volunteers  who are passionate about using technology and open data to improve the local community and enrich civic life in the District of Columbia and the greater Washington D.C. metro area. Established in 2012 as an informal volunteer group and Code for DC later became an official Code for America Brigade in 2013 with the non-profit Code for America, providing financial support.

Code for DC accomplishes its mission by:

- Providing the civic hacking community in the greater Washington D.C. metro area  a space for those interested in civic hacking to connect and have discussions around local civic hacking issues.
- Providing infrastructure to assist those developing projects related to civic hacking or community problem solving (e.g. open data catalog, listserv, etc)
- Hosting events such as bi-weekly hack nights, workshops, hackathons, and happy hours.
- Participating and supporting national and local focused hackathons such as National Day of Civic Hacking hackathon, International Open Data hackathon, and Rebuilding Re-Entry hackathons.
- Advising and collaborating with local government agencies and staff, along with other local community non-profits.
- Advocating for open data, open government , transparency, accountability, civic hacking

## Accomplishments

Over the three years, Code for DC has accomplished:

- Over 1,800 members with an average 50 members per hack night.
- Over 20 civic projects created. These projects include:
  - ANC Finder - A website to help citizens learn more about the DC's Advisory Neighborhood Commission system.
  - District Housing Application Assistant - which helps non-profit caseworkers help clients easily complete Section 8 housing forms; built in collaboration with Bread for the City
  - Open Elections Map - A live election map for DC's 2014 general election; built in collaboration with WAMU
  - Funds for At-Risk Students - Application that visualizes the distribution of DCPS At-Risk Funding; built in collaboration with the DC Fiscal Policy Institute
  - CaBi Odds - An application that shows the availability of bikes in Capital Bikeshare system
  - Clean Slate - A simple website for people trying to navigate the process of having records sealed in DC; built in collaboration with Mission: Launch
- Provided formal policy recommendations and comments to the Mayor of the District of Columbia in the form of an RFC response.
- Co-captain appointed by the mayor as newly-created Director of Innovation for the District.
- Co-captain appointed to a three-year term on the newly-created Open Government Advisory Group, a commission which advises the mayor and the District government on open government related issues.

## Priorities This Year

- Incorporate as a non-profit entity - Currently Code for DC exists as an all-volunteer organization with fiscal sponsorship from Code for America, which has extended it’s non-profit status to our organization. We seek to incorporated as a non-profit within the District of Columbia to create a more resilience, sustainable organization.

- Increase fundraising - Currently, Code for DC does not actively fundraise. Financial pressure prohibits growth and long-term stability. We seek to change this by proactively identifying potential donors and raising $10,000 (initial target goal).

- Create a new DC Data Commons - The District lacks a central resource for community members to find and share datasets related to the city. Code for DC seeks to create such a resource, potentially with other community organizations and/or the city, following the model of Open Data Philly.

- Improve the Code for DC experience - Code for DC faces several major organizational challenges associated with its members: (1) a lack of racial & socioeconomic diversity among members; (2) problems with both short- and long-term retention of volunteers.

## Outcomes

- Increase membership to 2,500 by December 2016 with an average of 70 members per hacknight
- Increase retention of existing members to 30%
- Increase racial and socioeconomic diversity; deploy a community survey to determine baseline
- Raise $10,000 in fundraising; identify 1-3 potential donors
