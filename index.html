        <h1>Join Code for DC!</h1>
        <p class="lead">Code for DC is the DC chapter of the Code for America Brigade. We are a group of volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues and enhance civic engagement.

Read about the projects we are working on, and our current team members.

<br> If youâ€™d like to get involved, please join our Meetup and Google groups. You can also help us work through our to-do list on our Trello board, or fix some bugs and add new features to our open source apps on GitHub.</p>
